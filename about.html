 <div class="div2">Originally formed in 1957, the Dapper Dans were conceived as an addition to the Main Street area of Disneyland by then-entertainment decorator Tommy Walker. The original quartet were hand selected from the Fred Waring Chorale by Chuck Corson, a talent booker for the park. Although the concept remained much the same, the Dapper Dans did not get their name until 1959, when it was suggested by bass singer T.J. Walker, who was the leader of the quartet at the time.
<br>
<br>
The Dapper Dans started out as a strictly musical act, but over time, evolved into more of a Vaudeville-esque comedy and talent act, often engaging directly with park-goers during their performances.
<br>
<br>
Although the Dapper Dans commonly travel throughout Disneyland, their 'home base', so to speak, is the Harmony Barbershop (named for the harmonies in their songs), where customers will occasionally be serenaded while actually receiving a haircut. As a side-note, the custom four-seater Schwinn tandem cycle used by the Dapper Dans was actually commissioned by Walt Disney himself, was an avid fan of the barbershop quartet sound.
<br>
<br>
The Dapper Dans also had counterparts in the United Kingdom and Hong Kong-based Disney theme parks, though the groups based out of Disneyland and Disney World in America are the only ones to endure.
<br>
<br>
The Dapper Dans perform in a quartet, as per their format, but in actuality, there are often a dozen or sometimes more members, who can perform in seperate locations throughout the park at the same time, or group together for bigger, more bombastic performances.
<br>
<br>
As a final bit of trivia, it has been estimated that the Dapper Dans have performed "Goodbye, My Coney Island Baby", considered to be one of their signature songs, a total of 50,000 times, since the act's inception.
